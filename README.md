I am a software developer with a strong background in backend engineering. I have a proven track record of solving complex backend problems with Python, Django, JavaScript and Also experience in AWS solution architecture specifically on serverless architecture and DevOps ( Lambda, Terraform, Dynamodb) . I'm looking to work with a company that shares my values and is willing to invest in me and my skills.
